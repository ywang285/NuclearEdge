# NuclearEdge
Custom-written MATLAB (tested in MATLAB R2021b) scripts to find nuclear edge, nuclear area and FISH spots, then calculate the the relative distance from the FISH spots to the nuclear edge (i.e., the distance from a FISH spot to the nuclear edge divided the square root of the nuclear area)
